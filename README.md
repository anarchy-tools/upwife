# upwife

For anarchists living in the middle class but attempting to bring in enough revenue for a legal purchase of land to fortify, there is a difficult challenge we are met with, detailed below:

If assets are liquidated to traditional banking systems in the amount needed for a land purchase, then the tax authority must be paid according to this chart, or they will capture you. It is not possible to fight them off, either. There will be too many.

Fortunately, if you pay close attention, you can reduce losses to world powers by up to 11% by acquiring a legal wife.

## What is a wife?

A wife is an adult individual who goes with you to a court house and appears with you before a judge, who provides a `marriage license` for a small fee.

Once you have the wife, her last name becomes what yours is, and you are able to add her social security number to your tax return along with yours as usual, then your tax bracket is lowered.

## Where do I get a wife?

Since the death of American culture in 2002, the only way to find a wife is to use applications designed for it. In practice, however, the amount of men who you will compete with to get the tax advantage is too high for modern wife applications to work properly.

upwife is a collection of scripts which can automate these applications. So far, Tinder is implemented, as well as Hinge. It is advisable to attempt to use the Tinder script because the tax advantage works optimally if the wife takes $0 income. There are more of those types of wives on Tinder than other platforms.

To run the Tinder script, install Tampermonkey chrome extension from the Chrome web store and create a new userscript. Paste the contents of `upwife-tinder.js` into the editor that appears, then save. Load the Tinder web application in Google Chrome at [https://tinder.com](https://tinder.com) and manually log-in to a Tinder account. Once loaded, it will begin the process of matching all potential wives in your desired radius.

To run the Hinge script, make sure adb is installed and working on a desktop or laptop computer, and if you are not on Linux, get a POSIX-compliant bash executable on the system you are using. It is most straightforward to acquire a cheap Android device, enable USB debugging, login to a Hinge account, then start the script `upwife-hinge.sh` in bash. It will begin the mass match attack on the network.

Allow the scripts to run for about a week, and don't bother trying to message any potential wives first. Best practice is to only attempt to wife-up ones that initialize a thread with your client without needing your user input. upwife should be able to match at least 120,000 potential wives over that timespan, freeing you up to continue your daily life.


## Further Work

- Use GPT-3 to initialize threads and automatically converse with potential wives
- androidx86 support to cut down expense of physical Android phone purchase, instead using qemu/virt-manager
